# SOLID definition:
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open/Closed Principle
Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## why?
-> it helps in reducing tight coupling i.e. a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which one should avoid in the code. Loosely coupled is good and allows making code more reusable.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
Every class should have 1 responsibility or 1 job/purpose

## Open/Closed principle
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification -> we should be able to extend a class behavior without modifying it


## Liskov's substitution principle:
derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes. This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behaviour.

ðŸŒŸ S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Keep it focused: Each class or module should have only one responsibility. It should be responsible for one thing and not take on multiple unrelated tasks.

Example: A class responsible for logging data should only be concerned with logging. It shouldnâ€™t be involved in processing data or managing business logic.

ðŸŒŸ O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Open for extension, closed for modification: You should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its existing code. This allows you to add new functionality without breaking existing code.

Example: If you're building a shipping calculator, instead of modifying the existing class when adding a new shipping method, you extend the class or use interfaces to add new methods without changing the old ones.

ðŸŒŸ L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Substitute without breaking: You should be able to use a subclass wherever the base class is used without breaking the program. This ensures that child classes can stand in for parent classes and still behave as expected.

Example: If you have a Bird class with a fly() method, and then a Penguin class extends it, it might violate Liskov if a Penguin can't fly. So, you'd rethink the design and either not let Penguin inherit Bird or ensure that only birds that can fly inherit that class.

ðŸŒŸ I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Avoid forcing clients to implement unused methods: Clients (whether they are objects or classes) should only be dependent on the methods that they use. Donâ€™t force classes to implement methods they donâ€™t need.

Example: Instead of having a massive Worker interface with methods for eat(), work(), and sleep(), create smaller, more focused interfaces like Worker, Eater, and Sleeper, so you can mix and match only the relevant methods.

ðŸŒŸ D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This reduces the tight coupling between different parts of the system.

Example: Instead of having a Car class depend directly on a Engine class, create an interface for the Engine and make Car depend on that abstraction, so you can plug in different types of engines without modifying Car.

ðŸš€ The Overall Goal of SOLID:
Loosely coupled design: Keep components independent and flexible. Changes in one part of the system should not affect others. This reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

Maintainability: The code becomes easier to maintain, as you donâ€™t need to change or refactor existing parts every time a new feature is added.

Extensibility: Itâ€™s easy to extend the functionality of your application without changing existing code.

Testability: Because classes are independent, testing is easier and more isolated.
