/*
ðŸ§  Intuitive understanding:
If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T should be replaceable with objects of type S without breaking the program.

ðŸ”¥ Simple meaning:
Wherever a parent class object is expected, you should be able to use a child class object without any surprises.

Child class must behave properly like its parent.
